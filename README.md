4. **Run the App**: Build and run the app in debug mode by executing `flutter run`.

5. **APK Build Location**: The debug APK will be located at: `âˆš Built build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`.

2. **Connect Device to Computer**: Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable.

3. **Transfer the APK**: Find `app-debug.apk` in your project directory and transfer it to your device.

4. **Install the App**: Use a file manager on your device to locate and open the APK file, then follow the prompts to install it.
